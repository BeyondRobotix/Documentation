# Engineering Change Notice



## Micro CAN Node development board

### V1.1 release

Moving forward, CAN node development boards will be V1.1. The V1.0 boards can be purchased on special request, and we will have a limited stock immediately available for the time being.&#x20;

V1.1 improves on flexibility for development, exposing more GPIO pins and providing more 3.3V and 5V pin access. The board is slightly bigger to accommodate this change, as such the mounting holes have also moved position. The SPI port is no longer accessible via JSTGH but can be accessed through the GPIO pads instead. &#x20;
